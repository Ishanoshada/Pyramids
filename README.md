## About

The Pyramids project allows you to work with pyramid data and perform various calculations related to their dimensions. It includes Python scripts to calculate volume, surface area, and other properties of pyramids, as well as a JSON file containing information about different pyramids from around the world.

## File Structure

```plaintext

```

- `create_pyramidV1.py`: Python script for calculating blocks needed for a specific pyramid.
- `create_pyramidV2.py`: Improved Python script for calculating pyramid properties with user input.
- `pyramids.py`: Python script for calculating pyramid properties with predefined dimensions.
- `Pyramids.json`: JSON file containing information about various pyramids.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Installation

To use the provided Python scripts, make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

You can use the Python scripts to perform calculations on pyramids or explore the pyramid data in the JSON file. Refer to the specific script's usage instructions for details.

## Examples

### JSON Data

You can access pyramid data in the `Pyramids.json` file. Here's an example of the data format:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Great Pyramid of Giza",
        "height": 146.6,
        ...
    },
    {
        "name": "Pyramid of Khafre",
        "height": 136.4,
        ...
    },
    ...
]
```

### Calculations

#### Using `create_pyramidV1.py`

```bash
python create_pyramidV1.py
```

This script calculates the number of blocks needed to build a specific pyramid.

#### Using `create_pyramidV2.py`

```bash
python create_pyramidV2.py
```

This script allows you to input pyramid dimensions and calculates properties like volume and slope angle.

#### Using `pyramids.py`

```bash
python pyramids.py
```

This script calculates pyramid properties with predefined dimensions.
